    <p> Our project shows a visual representation of the solar system. As you can see from the visual, there is the sun in the center and planet with their orbit paths. Each planet shows the size and color. We added in 8 planets to show the solar system. We used coding to adjust the pensize, color, shape, etc to show this Out of this World Presentation! </p>
