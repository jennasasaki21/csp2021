    <p> Our project shows a visual representation of the solar system. As you can see from the visual, there is the sun in the center and planet with their orbit paths. Each planet shows the size and color. We added in 8 planets to show the solar system. We used coding to adjust the pensize, color, shape, etc to show this Out of this World Presentation! </p>

    <p> This is my group's 1.2.5 project. In this project we used gifs to create a basketball game. In this game, there is a pink basketball that moves from side to side on the top of the screen. Once you press a key on your keyboard, the basketball drops. This coding is very similar to our "Apple Avalanche" PLTW lesson. Each time you make the basketball into the basket, the score increases. Your goal is to make the basketball inside the basket each time to get the highest score possible! </p>p>
