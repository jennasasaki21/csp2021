    <p> Our project shows a visual representation of the solar system. As you can see from the visual, there is the sun in the center and planet with their orbit paths. Each planet shows the size and color. We added in 8 planets to show the solar system. We used coding to adjust the pensize, color, shape, etc to show this Out of this World Presentation! </p>

    <p> This is my group's 1.2.5 project. In this project we used gifs to create a basketball game. In this game, there is a pink basketball that moves from side to side on the top of the screen. Once you press a key on your keyboard, the basketball drops. This coding is very similar to our "Apple Avalanche" PLTW lesson. Each time you make the basketball into the basket, the score increases. Your goal is to make the basketball inside the basket each time to get the highest score possible! </p>

    <p> This is my group's 1.3.1 PLTW Game Project. In this interactive game, users move minions to play ping pong! The minions act as a paddle as you can move them up and down. In the background, we have Gru from Despicable Me. When the ball hits the wall, the opposing side player wins a point. The first player to reach 7 points wins the game! This game of ping pong allows user movement and also has fun minion characters from the Despicable Me movie! </p>

    <p> This is my group's Scratch Project! In this project, we made a tour of famous spots in San Diego. We used different Sprites to show the tour and also changed the backgrounds. In the Project, we have trivia  questions about the history or fun facts of San Diego. If the player gets the question correct, the score goes up by one point. If they get the question incorrect, the score remains unchanged. We went to Coronado Beach, the San Diego Zoo, the Airport, Petco Park, and Gaslamp.
